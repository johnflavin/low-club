    "# Low Club ♣\n",
    "Recreating my low club script, but better.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want to do is \"deal\" $N$ hands of Spades. We simulate the first trick as Schuster-Rules \"everyone throws out their low club\". We keep track of how many times each value of club wins or loses these first tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "How this will work in code is this:\n",
    "* Make a big data frame of \"hands\". There are $N$ rows and 52 columns. Each column is an integer, representing a card.\n",
    "    * $0$–$12$ are the 2 through Ace of Clubs\n",
    "    * $13$–$25$ are the 2 through Ace of Diamonds\n",
    "    * $26$–$38$ are the 2 through Ace of Hearts\n",
    "    * $39$–$51$ are the 2 through Ace of Spades\n",
    "* The columns come in four groups, representing the players. The values in those columns are the cards dealt to that player.\n",
    "    * Columns `0`–`12` are player 1\n",
    "    * Columns `13`–`25` are player 2\n",
    "    * Columns `26`–`38` are player 3\n",
    "    * Columns `39`–`51` are player 4\n",
    "* We want to keep stats on which cards win or lose each game.\n",
    "    * Look at each player's cards by breaking the columns into groups\n",
    "    * Check if any player has all spades (this is an incredibly rare edge case, explained more below)\n",
    "    * Find each player's lowest club. This is almost always their lowest card, unless their lowest card is above 12 in which case they have no clubs and cannot win the trick.\n",
    "    * The highest low club wins the trick, and the others lose.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge case: all spades\n",
    "Spades are a trump suit, so if a spade comes out on a trick it will take the trick (unless a higher value spade plays over it). But no one can play spades until they are \"broken\", and they can't be broken on the first trick. *Unless* someone has a hand of 13 spades. In that case, they win all the tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds of this happening are incredibly low. But if we play a lot of games, it is something we may see. So we have to check for it."
