Low Club
John Flavin

In Schuster Rules Spades, eveyone throws their lowest club on the first trick. The question is: Given that my lowest club is X, how likely am I to win? Or, since these odds are only important when trying to make a Nil bid, the better question is: How likely am I to lose?

The program simply randomizes a 'deck' of 52 integers, deals them out, sees what every person's lowest club is, then counts how often each card wins or loses.

USAGE
Pass the order of magnitude of execution to the command line.
